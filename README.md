# Invisible Remote: Hands-Free PC Control Using Head Pose & Computer Vision
A real-time computer vision system that enables complete hands-free control of a PC using head orientation and motion. The system interprets head yaw, pitch, and roll to perform browser tab switching, mouse clicks, and scrolling without any hand gestures.

🚀 Features

- Real-time head pose estimation using MediaPipe Face Mesh

- Look left/right → browser tab navigation

- Head nod → mouse click

- Head tilt → smooth scrolling

- Gesture conflict resolution using intent-based priority logic

- Secure single-user detection (multi-face ignored)

- Simultaneous webcam + screen recording for proof-of-interaction

- Built entirely in Python
